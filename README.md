Predicting the occasions that clothing items are
worn for isnâ€™t necessarily the most
straightforward task. With some basic review
information, you can make a reasonably decent
estimation of what occasion an item is for. In our
exploratory analysis, we utilized text based
reviews to predict what kinds of categories
clothing items would be worn for. This method is
by no means comprehensive and has much
room for improvement, but it serves as a
framework for what basic estimation methods
should look like in the world of Recommender
Systems.
